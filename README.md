## News

[2024.04] ðŸ”¥ A refined implementation of Chat-3D v2 is released. The old version v2.0 has been archived in branch v2_0. This main branch is now for the new version (v2.1).

[2024.01] Update training guide for grounding on ScanRefer.

[2023.12] Code release. The main training architecture is based on our former work [Chat-3D](https://github.com/Chat-3D/Chat-3D).

## v2.1 vs v2.0

- <details>
  <summary>Main changes</summary>

  - LLM backbone: Vicuna v0 -> [Vicuna v1.5](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/docs/vicuna_weights_version.md) + LoRA finetuning

  - Training scheme: three-stage training -> one-stage joint training

  - Segmentor: [PointGroup](https://github.com/dvlab-research/PointGroup) -> [Mask3D](https://github.com/JonasSchult/Mask3D)
  
  - Code Optimization:
    - batch size: 1 -> 32
    - Simpler training and evaluating process

## ðŸ”¨ Preparation

- Prepare the environment:
  
  (Different from v2.0)
  ```shell
  conda create -n chat-3d-v2 python=3.9.17
  conda activate chat-3d-v2
  conda install pytorch==2.2.1 torchvision==0.17.1 torchaudio==2.2.1 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- Download LLM backbone:
  -  We use Vicuna-7B v1.5 in our experiments, which can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5).

  - Change the `llama_model_path` in [config.py](./scripts/config.py) to the location of `vicuna-7b-v1.5`.
  

- Annotations and extracted features:
  
  Please follow the instructions in [preprocess](preprocess/).


## ðŸ¤– Training and Inference

- Training
  - Modify [run.sh](scripts/run.sh):
    ```python
    train_tag="scanrefer#scan2cap#scanqa#sqa3d#multi3dref#nr3d_caption#obj_align"
    val_tag="scanrefer#scan2cap#scanqa#sqa3d#multi3dref"
    evaluate=False
    ```

    <details>
    <summary> Explanation of "train_tag" and "val_tag" </summary>

    - Use `#` to seperate different datasets

    - Datasets:
      - `scanrefer`: [ScanRefer](https://github.com/daveredrum/ScanRefer) Dataset
      - `scan2cap`: [Scan2Cap](https://github.com/daveredrum/Scan2Cap) Dataset
      - `scanqa`: [ScanQA](https://github.com/ATR-DBI/ScanQA) Dataset
      - `sqa3d`: [SQA3D](https://github.com/SilongYong/SQA3D) Dataset
      - `multi3dref`: [Multi3dRefer](https://github.com/3dlg-hcvc/M3DRef-CLIP) Dataset_
      - `nr3d_caption`: A captioning dataset originated from [Nr3D](https://github.com/referit3d/referit3d).
      - `obj_align`: A dataset originated from ScanRefer to align the object identifiers with object tokens.
    
    - You can try different combination of training datasets or add costumized datasets.

    </details>
  - Run: `bash scripts/run.sh`

  - Brief training info:

    | Batch Size | GPU | VRAM Usage per GPU | Training Time | ckpt |
    | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
    | 32 | 4 * A100 | ~ 70 GB | ~ 8 hours | [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hv-N-p9tm6nhoe6tlbZANgxYIjuVvX1n/view?usp=sharing) |
    | 1 | 1 * A100 | ~ 28 GB | ~ 3 days | - |


- Inference
  
  - Modify [run.sh](scripts/run.sh): (We provide the pretrained checkpoint in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19wOjXYjca6w3JRVzbbFMgwiQj6kd6MXQ?usp=drive_link))
  
    ```python
    val_tag="multi3dref#scanqa#scanrefer#sqa3d#scan2cap"
    evaluate=False
    pretrained_path="/path/to/pretrained_model.pth"
    ```
  
  - Run: `bash scripts/run.sh`
