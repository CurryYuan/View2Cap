# Chat-Scene

We build a multi-modal large language model for 3D scene understanding, excelling in tasks such as 3D grounding, captioning, and question answering.


## News

**[2024.08]** ðŸ”¥ We released Chat-Scene, capable of processing both 3D point clouds and 2D multi-view images for improved 3D scene understanding, leading to significant advancements in grounding and captioning performance. (Paper to be released soon.)

**[2024.04]** We released a refined implementation (v2.1), which achieved better performance on grounding, captioning, and QA tasks. The code is available in branch [v2.1](https://github.com/Chat-3D/Chat-3D-v2/tree/v2.1).

**[2023.12]** We released Chat-3D v2 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08168)], introducing object identifiers for enhanced object referencing and grounding in 3D scenes. The original code is available in branch [v2.0](https://github.com/Chat-3D/Chat-3D-v2/tree/v2.0).

  <small>\*The v2.1 and Chat-Scene results are based on single models **without task-specific finetuning**.

  \*All results are from the validation set. (Test set results will be released soon.)</small>

- Main Changes
  <details>
  <summary> New features in Chat-Scene </summary>

  - Introduce a 2D token for each object, with 2D representations extracted from multi-view images using [DINOv2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2).

  - Enable processing of 2D ego-centric video using a tracking-based detector when 3D input is unavailable.

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary> New features in v2.1 (Chat-Scene is built upon v2.1) </summary>

  - LLM backbone: Vicuna v0 -> [Vicuna v1.5](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/docs/vicuna_weights_version.md) + LoRA.

  - Training scheme: three-stage training -> one-stage joint training.

  - Detector: [PointGroup](https://github.com/dvlab-research/PointGroup) -> [Mask3D](https://github.com/JonasSchult/Mask3D).
  
  - Code Optimization:
    - batch size: 1 -> 32.
    - Simplified training and evaluation processes.
  </details>

## ðŸ”¨ Preparation

- Prepare the environment:
  
  ```shell
  conda create -n chat-scene python=3.9.17
  conda activate chat-scene
  conda install pytorch==2.2.1 torchvision==0.17.1 torchaudio==2.2.1 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- Download LLM backbone:
  -  We use Vicuna-7B v1.5 in our experiments, which can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5).

  - Change the `llama_model_path` in [config.py](./scripts/config.py) to the path of `vicuna-7b-v1.5`.
  

- Annotations and extracted features:
  
  Please follow the instructions in [preprocess](preprocess/).


## ðŸ¤– Training and Inference

- Training
  - Modify [run.sh](scripts/run.sh):
    ```python
    train_tag="scanrefer#scan2cap#scanqa#sqa3d#multi3dref#nr3d_caption#obj_align"
    val_tag="scanrefer#scan2cap#scanqa#sqa3d#multi3dref"
    evaluate=False
    ```

    <summary> Explanation of "train_tag" and "val_tag" </summary>

    - Use `#` to seperate different datasets

    - Datasets:
      - `scanrefer`: [ScanRefer](https://github.com/daveredrum/ScanRefer) Dataset
      - `scan2cap`: [Scan2Cap](https://github.com/daveredrum/Scan2Cap) Dataset
      - `scanqa`: [ScanQA](https://github.com/ATR-DBI/ScanQA) Dataset
      - `sqa3d`: [SQA3D](https://github.com/SilongYong/SQA3D) Dataset
      - `multi3dref`: [Multi3dRefer](https://github.com/3dlg-hcvc/M3DRef-CLIP) Dataset
      - `nr3d_caption`: A captioning dataset originated from [Nr3D](https://github.com/referit3d/referit3d).
      - `obj_align`: A dataset originated from ScanRefer to align the object identifiers with object tokens.
    
    - You can try different combination of training datasets or add costumized datasets.
